        you've learned from those tutorials.

        If you're having a hard time with your own projects, maybe they're too big. Start small, 
        and then work your way up to more complicated projects.`,

        In this codelab, you'll create a simple mobile Flutter app. If you're familiar with 
        object-oriented code and basic programming concepts—such as variables, loops, and 
        conditionals—then you can complete the codelab. You don't need previous experience with
        Dart, mobile, desktop, or web programming.`,
